### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Mark Ayiah, and I am a junior at Yale University studying Statistics & Data Science. Here are some things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my data science portfolio to gain more project experience and a better appreciation for the research process from start to finish.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use geographical software (Geopandas & ArcGIS) to make map visualizations and storyboards as part of my summer data science REU for social good.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm technically Ghanaian royalty!
