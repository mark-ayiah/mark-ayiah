### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Mark Ayiah, and I am a sophomore at Yale University studying Statistics & Data Science. Here are some things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on brainstorming a project to use sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze NBA twitter...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Python and R for machine learning along with some data visualziation techniques to make my projects more accessible.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm technically Ghanaian royalty!
